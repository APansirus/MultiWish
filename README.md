# MultiWish
a probability calculation for a DnD5e party with multiple casters able to cast "Wish"

In DnD5e, casting Wish can lead to never being able to cast Wish again. These are programs to calculate how the probabilities of never being able to cast Wish again  change if there is more than one caster able to cast Wish in the party. One program is for a game without Simulacra, the other one is for a game with Simulacra, but with restrictions on them (they can't cast Simulacrum, and if they lose the ability to cast Wish, the original caster loses the abililty to cast Wish, too).
